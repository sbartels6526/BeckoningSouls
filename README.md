Long ago, the demon Cerise was ordained into eternal darkness by an unknown entity after committing a mortal sin against the people of Kohno. His fate was condemned into The Forest of Gehenna. Due to this, peace was restored throughout the village.  Cerise's minions however,rose to take revenge. They would take the souls of the people who lived amongst the light and put Kohno in danger and it is your job to save the souls and the villagers.

In order to repossess the souls, Zen must accept the challenge of defeating the waves of lesser demons. The first level will consist of a wave of demons which will be relatively easier to kill since their health will be lower than Zenâ€™s own health and need to be shot to be killed. However, as the game progresses to the next level, the demons come in a larger pack and have higher health. Zen can be moved using the arrow keys(left and right). If the space bar is pressed, Zen is able to shoot at his opponent(s). If the the mouse is moved then you can position the arrow to shoot. This is essential for the defeat of all the minions. At the final level, Zen will be facing attacks and demons that are harder to kill than any of the other demons. If you succeeded in defeating the demons after all three level you will return back to the village with the souls and save the people of Kohno.
