Long ago, the demon Cerise was ordained into eternal darkness by an unknown entity after committing a mortal sin against the people of Kohno. His fate was condemned into The Forest of Gehenna, where his heart was thought to forever linger amongst the shadows. Due to this, peace was restored throughout the village.  Cerise rose again with newfound strength to avenge what was once his. He would take the souls of the people who lived amongst the light. It is believed that one who deems worthy (Zen) will descend to represent Kohno and defeat Cerise… or join him.

In order to repossess the souls, Zen must accept the challenge of defeating the waves of lesser demons sent by Cerise. The first level will consist of 2 waves of demons which will be relatively easier to kill since their health will be lower than Zen’s own health. However, as the game progresses to the next level, the demons come in a larger pack and have higher health and need to be shot to be killed. Zen can be moved using the arrow keys(left and right). If the spacebar is pressed, Zen is able to shoot at his opponent(s). If the the mouse is moved then you can position the arrow to shoot.This is essential for Cerise’s demise. At the final level, Zen will come face to face with Cerise, who will have more health than any other demon. You have attacks and have to kill both Cerise and his minions. If Cerise’s health runs out and the village is still intact, the game is over and all the souls Cerise took are returned to the villagers.
